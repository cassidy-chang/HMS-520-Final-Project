### Part I: Data Wrangling
  - Change names to be more readable and intuitive
  - CD4 (upper and lower) - multiply by 10
  - Sum CD4 variables into one to get average CD4 count
  - Separate age variable (lower limit and upper limit)
  - Create a variable indicating the length of study

```{r}

```

  
### Part II: Data Analysis
  - Descriptive analysis
  - Attempt k-means/agglomerative/spectral clustering and see if predictive of time since ART 
  - Running different regression models with different sets of covariates and mortality and use of ART as outcomes
  - Comparing models with select goodness of fit tests

```{r}

```


### Part III: Visualization
  - Plot regression outputs 
  - Plot goodness of fit tests
  - Visualization with PCA and TSNE 

```{r}

```
